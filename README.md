# Test
This is my first repository.


## Getting Started
It includes a simple function called ``hello()``. This is an example of how to use it
```{r}
hello()
```

The output is ``"Hello, world!"``. I have added a new function called ``test()``. This function computes 1 + 1.

### Prerequisites

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
